# escape_game

You may have to edit out the Steamworks code at the beginning and throughout to run it without buying the game.  

This is an escape the room game that pays homage to the old flash games where one finds themselves in a room and you have to figure out how to escape.  The game is pretty hard and might be a little clunky, as it was my first huge project that I've ever tried.  It is available on Steam (for a small price right now, will most likely be free in the future) and successfully uses the Steam Overlay and has Steam achievements.  It ONLY works on Windows 10 for some reason via Steam. 

This was written entirely in Python with Pygame, but uses a Steamworks module for Python.  Someone did post a walkthrough of the game on Steam. 

This was written in Python 3.7, but I've tested it for 3.9.

Features:
